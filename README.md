A tamper-proof encrypted portable Notepad that only requires a webbrowser to "run" and that allows you to keep sensitive information (such as passwords) fully protected. It was developed in HTML + Javascript, and so it is distributed and runs in its source code format in any browser (desktop, notebook or cellphone).It writes and reads its data files using a "composition" of a user chosen "password" AND the current "souce-code" (HTML + javascript) signature, that it evaluates on every run. Thus, if someone changes the source code ("tamper" with the code), the previous data files will not be decrypted anymore using only the original password- only the original code (web-page) will allow someone to recover the original data with the correct password. There is a "validation data file" available with the distribution that alows you to validate the program before using it, so that you do not risk giving up your password to an altered program. For your data safety, you can generate your own validation file with a known contents to be able to check the program later, before using it, to avoid disclosing your passwords to a possibly altered ("tampered with") program.
